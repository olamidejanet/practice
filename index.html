</h1>
    <p>
        Digital media is the dissemination of information, ideas, knowledge through the internet. Digital media can be created, viewed, transmitted, and disseminated on a digital electronics device. Digital media refers to any information that is broadcast through a screen. This includes text, audio, video, and graphics that are transmitted over the internet for viewing on the internet. Digital media are technologies or means used to communicate, share, disseminate, and create information and ideas to a heterogeneous group of people in different locations.
With the advent of ICT, digital media has become a crucial issue in reaching more people and reaching them faster too in teaching and learning. The use of new multimedia technologies and the internet in learning is seen as a means to improve accessibility, efficiency, and quality of learning by facilitating access to resources. 
Modern advancements in the field of computer and communication technology have offered tremendous opportunity for learning by electronic means (Rozina, 2002). Abraham (2020) defined Digital media as any communication media that operate with the use of any various encoded machine-readable formats. 
According to Sale (2002), digital learning is the use of electronic technology to deliver education and training applications, monitor learner’s performance and report learner’s progress. The applications and process of digital learning include computer-based learning, web-based learning, virtual classroom and digital collaboration where contents is delivered via the internet, intranet/extranet, audio and or video tapes, satellite TV and CD-ROM (Islam 1997). While digital media, which includes television, radio, websites, social media, podcast, email, mobile apps such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, LMS software, Blog, and podcast, didn't come into everyday use until the late 20th century, it was seldomly use among the educational sector. It became remarkably effective and widely used after the Coronavirus outbreak.
